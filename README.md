# Surveys
* Survey on rain removal from videos or a single image (SCI China 2021) [[pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11432-020-3225-9.pdf?pdf=button)]
* Single image deraining: From model-based to data-driven and beyond (TPAMI 2020) [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07150)]
  * Combine Model-driven and Data-driven (e.g., deep unroll)
  * Semi/unsupervised learning, domain adaptation, transfer learning
  * Fast, small, robust video deraining
  * Deraining as Task-specific preprocessing
  * Multi-task learning (e.g., with snow, haze)

* A Survey of Single Image De-raining in 2020 (Arxiv 2020) [[pdf](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-3945-6_75)]
  * Solve Over-derain, Under-derain, and residual artifacts
  * Simplfy network architectures and modules
  * Use unpaired training data with natural (i.e., real-world) rains
