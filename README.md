# Surveys
* Survey on rain removal from videos or a single image [[pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11432-020-3225-9.pdf?pdf=button)]
  * Limitations & Future Works
      * Remove (oversmooth) background texture -> task-specific metrics
      * Not realistic rain modeling -> deep unroll for integrating model-/data-driven approaches
      * Poor efficiency for videos -> lightweight designs
      * Poor generalization ability -> semi-/unsupervised learning, trasfer learing, domain adaptation
      * Other bad weahers (e.g., haze, snow)
